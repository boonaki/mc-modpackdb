## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, EJS, Node, JWT

Underneath the hood, there is login functionality using JWT, as well as hashed passwords and admin verification. Guest users, or even newly created accounts, are *not* able to edit the modpack collection, but can view the collection via the '/info' endpoint. Adding the modpacks into the DB involves API calls to other Web API's such as [curseforge's](https://docs.curseforge.com) API and from [modpack index](https://modpackindex.docs.apiary.io/#).

## What we learned:

We built this project mainly as a passion project, as the developers of this website are heavy enthusiasts for modded minecraft. We dived deep into this project so we can use it as a reference for future projects, so we only hope that developers that stumble across this can get value from it as well, whether it be finding a new modpack to play or looking back to what we wrote to improve or enhance their projects.
