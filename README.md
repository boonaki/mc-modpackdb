## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, EJS, Express.js, JWT

Underneath the hood, there is login functionality using JWT, as well as hashed passwords and admin verification. Guest users, or even newly created accounts, are *not* able to edit the modpack collection, but can view the collection via the '/info' endpoint. Adding the modpacks into the DB involves API calls to other Web API's such as [curseforge's](https://docs.curseforge.com) API and from [modpack index](https://modpackindex.docs.apiary.io/#).
